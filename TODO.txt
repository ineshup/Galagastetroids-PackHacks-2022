what we need to complete the prototype:
- game over
- basic scoring system (now displays, needs polishing)

don't forget the demo video and form submission!

game design stuff:
- game gets harder over time
    - snake getting longer is good challenge
- indicate tetris and ghost spawn locations
- try to make shooting while turning more smooth
- prevent tail from lagging behind while speeding up snake (shift list multiple times?)

good to have for judging:
- pause button
- sound effects
- visual (explosion) effects
- menu

extras:
- intro cutscene
- eyeballs face direction of motion?
- amogus cheat code
